Threema Web is a web client for Threema, a privacy-focussed end-to-end
encrypted mobile messenger hosted and developed in Switzerland. With Threema
Web, you can use Threema on your Desktop without compromising security.

Threema Web establishes a connection between Desktop and mobile device using
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) (Android) or encrypted WebSockets (iOS).
Signaling and data is end-to-end encrypted with [SaltyRTC](https://saltyrtc.org/).

Whitepaper](https://threema.ch/press-files/2_documentation/cryptography_whitepaper.pdf).

Note that Threema Web is in maintenance mode while we are working on a new
solution that should resolve some of the long-standing issues we were having
with Threema Web. We will still do regular maintenance and fix critical bugs,
but for now there will be no major new features or non-critical bugfixes.  See
https://github.com/threema-ch/threema-web/pull/996 for details.


## Beta Testing

We may occasionally deploy experimental branches on
[https://web-beta.threema.ch](https://web-beta.threema.ch) which you are
encouraged to test. If you encounter problems, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/threema-ch/threema-web/issues/new) and
include the experiment’s version number (e.g. `1.2.3-experiment-beta4`).


## Translating

If you want to help translate Threema Web to your language, please check out
[`TRANSLATING.md`](./TRANSLATING.md)!


## Protocol

The protocol used to communicate between the Threema app and Threema Web
is documented [here](https://threema-ch.github.io/app-remote-protocol/).


## Development

Threema Web is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[AngularJS 1](https://www.angularjs.org/). Dependencies are managed with
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). You currently need Node.js 18 to build Threema
Web. (Note that Node.js is only a build dependency, the result is plain old
client-side JavaScript.)

If your default NodeJS version is not 18, use nvm to install it:

    nvm install
    nvm use

Install development dependencies:

    npm install

Run the dev server:

    npm run devserver

Then open the URL in your browser:

    firefox http://localhost:9966

*(Note that this setup should not be used in production. To run Threema
Web on a server, please follow the instructions at
[docs/self_hosting.md](docs/self_hosting.md).)*


## Testing

To run unit tests:

    npm run build:unittests && npm run testserver
    firefox http://localhost:7777/tests/testsuite.html

To run UI tests:

    npm run build  # Required for CSS to be rebuilt
    npm run test:ui <browser>

For example:

    npm run test:ui firefox
    npm run test:ui chrome

You can also filter the test cases:

    npm run test:ui firefox emoji

To run linting checks:

    npm run lint

You can also install a pre-push hook to do the linting:

    echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nnpm run lint' > .git/hooks/pre-push
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push


## Configuration

The configuration of Threema Web can be tweaked in
[`src/config.ts`](src/config.ts) and [`src/userconfig.js`](src/userconfig.js) /
[`src/userconfig.overrides.js`](src/userconfig.overrides.js) (see
[`src/userconfig.overrides.js.example`](src/userconfig.overrides.js.example).
The config variables are defined at build time, and the userconfig variables
can be modified at runtime. Please refer to those files for documentation on
what variables exist and how to configure them.

In the Docker image, all userconfig variables can be overridden using env
variables. See [`docs/docker.md`](docs/docker.md) for more information.
