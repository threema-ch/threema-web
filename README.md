Threema Web establishes a connection between Desktop and mobile device using
[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) (Android) or encrypted WebSockets (iOS).
Signaling and data is end-to-end encrypted with [SaltyRTC](https://saltyrtc.org/).

For more information, see the [Threema Cryptography
Whitepaper](https://threema.ch/press-files/2_documentation/cryptography_whitepaper.pdf).

## Development

Threema Web is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and
[AngularJS 1](https://www.angularjs.org/). Dependencies are managed with
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). You currently need Node.js 8 or later to build
Threema Web. (Note that Node.js is only a build dependency, the result is plain
old client-side JavaScript.)

Install development dependencies:

    npm install

Run the dev server:

    npm run devserver

Then open the URL in your browser:

    firefox http://localhost:9966

*(Note that this setup should not be used in production. To run Threema
Web on a server, please follow the instructions at
[docs/self_hosting.md](docs/self_hosting.md).)*


## Testing

To run tests:

    npm run build && npm run build:tests
    firefox tests/testsuite.html

To run linting checks:

    npm run lint

You can also install a pre-push hook to do the linting:

    echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nnpm run lint' > .git/hooks/pre-push
    chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push


## Configuration

The configuration of Threema Web can be tweaked in `src/config.ts`:

**General**

- `SELF_HOSTED`: Set this to `true` if this instance of Threema Web isn't being
  hosted on `web.threema.ch`.
- `PREV_PROTOCOL_LAST_VERSION`: When the Threema Web protocol version changes,
  this can be set to the last version of Threema Web that supported  the
  previous protocol version. If set to something different than `null`, a
  message will be shown to the user if reconnecting fails.

**SaltyRTC**

- `SALTYRTC_HOST`: Set this to the hostname of the SaltyRTC server that you
  want to use. If set to `null`, the hostname will be constructed based on the
  `SALTYRTC_HOST_PREFIX` and the `SALTYRTC_HOST_SUFFIX` values.
- `SALTYRTC_PORT`: The port of the SaltyRTC server to be used.
- `SALTYRTC_SERVER_KEY`: The public permanent key of the SaltyRTC server. Set
  this value to `null` if your server does not provide a public permanent key,
  or if you don't want to verify it.

**ICE**

- `ICE_SERVERS`: Configuration object for the WebRTC STUN and ICE servers.

**Push**

- `PUSH_URL`: The server URL used to deliver push notifications to the app.
